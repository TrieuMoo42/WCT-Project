# Ising Formulation for Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) Maximum Likelihood Channel Estimation (MLCE)

Converting the maximum likelihood channel estimation (MLCE) problem into the Ising form, enabling simulated annealing (SA) and parallel tempering (PT).

## Setup

1. This project uses the open-source heuristic solver, **PySA**, provided by NASA. It can be installed by using `pip` directly from the `Github` repository:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/nasa/pysa
```
2. Dependencies:
```
